Marina Hofer Bachelors Thesis investigating SNA of 15 hens moved into new, larger social setting

This data was collected as part of Klara Grethen's PhD project where an initial group of 20 hens is moved into a group of 120 hens. Five hens are removed at transfer for tissue sampling, meaning 15 hens are moved to the larger group.
