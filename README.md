Marina Hofer Bachelors Thesis investigating SNA of 15 hens across social environments.

This data was collected as part of Klara Grethen's PhD, where an initial group of 20 hens is moved into a group of 120 hens. Five hens are removed at transfer for tissue sampling, meaning 15 hens are moved to the larger group.  

Data was collected in 2021 with three replicates (Pens D, E, and F).

To determine the social networks pre-transition, we checked video of pens on three different occasions across 7 different days totaling 21 observations. Birds were associated with one another during the time period if they were within one hen length.  

Birds were then moved to larger pens with 120 individuals. We determined the social network during the first five days and the last five days (20-25) in the pen by dividing each day into seconds and determining where our focal birds are based upon the RFID antenna. If multiple focal birds were on the same antenna, these birds were associated. This methods, although potentially inflating our social associations (these are temporally autocorrelated), was necessary because of the low association scores overall.
